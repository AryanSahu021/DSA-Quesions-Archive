# DSA Questions Archive

This repository contains various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) question codes that I have written as part of course work for DSA I & DSA II. Each file focuses on a specific problem or game implementation. Below is a brief description of each file and the problem it addresses. 

## Contents

### Game Solvers
- **cube.c**: Solves a rubix cube puzzle using backtracking techniques.
- **connect4.c**: Implements the Connect Four game, where two players take turns dropping discs into a grid, aiming to connect four in a row.
- **sim.c**: Implements The Game of Sim, a pencil-and-paper game for two players that involves connecting dots.
- **upitup.c**: Implements the Up it Up game, where players rotate the boxes according to certain rules.

### Other DSA Problems
- **matrix.c**: Solves the Matrix Chain Multiplication problem, which finds the most efficient way to multiply a given sequence of matrices.
- **max_independent_set.c**: Solves the Maximum Independent Sets problem, which finds the largest set of vertices in a graph that are not adjacent.
- **max_intervals.c**: Solves the Maximum Non-Overlapping Intervals problem, which selects the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals from a given set.
- **num_paths.c**: Calculates the number of paths for a robot to reach the bottom-right corner of a matrix with obstacles, starting from the top-left corner.
- **tree_traversal.c**: Implements simple tree traversal algorithm.

## Usage

Each file can be compiled and executed using a C compiler. For example, to compile and run `cube.c`, use the following commands:

```bash
gcc cube.c -o cube
./cube
